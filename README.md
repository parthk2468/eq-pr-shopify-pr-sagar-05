## Objective:

To assess the candidate's advanced abilities in Shopify development with a focus on the Hydrogen platform and incorporating dynamic product metafields into the Product Detail Page (PDP).

## Duration:

75 minutes

## Tools and Resources:

- Shopify Developer account
- Hydrogen CLI
- Code editor (e.g., VSCode)
- Internet access

## Scenario:

Imagine you are building a new and highly customized product page for a Shopify store selling high-end handcrafted furniture. The client wants the page to be interactive and informative, showcasing unique product details and variations. In addition to standard product information, the page should dynamically display product metafields, allowing for richer product descriptions and specifications.

## Tasks:

### Part 1: Shopify Development with Metafields (45 minutes):

### 1. Metafields Setup:

#### Create several product metafields in Shopify admin, including:

- Material type (e.g., wood, metal, fabric)
- Dimensions (length, width, height)
- Weight
- Additional product features (e.g., handcrafted, sustainable)

#### PDP Implementation:

Build a basic PDP prototype using Liquid and Javascript, focusing on:

- Fetching product data and metafields using Shopify API calls
- Conditional rendering of product information based on metafield values
- Customizing product descriptions with metafields
- Implementing interactive features like image zoom and variant selection
- Ensure proper error handling and data validation.

### Part 2: Hydrogen Integration with Metafields (30 minutes):

#### 1. Hydrogen Component Conversion:

- Convert the existing Liquid and Javascript code to Hydrogen components.
- Leverage built-in Hydrogen features for:
- Product image gallery with zoom
- Variant selection with live updates
- Dynamic content rendering based on metafields
- Integration with Hydrogen's GraphQL client for data fetching
- Implement custom Hydrogen components for specific metafield displays.

#### 2. Styling and Optimization:

- Style the Hydrogen components with CSS-in-JS for a seamless and responsive design.
- Optimize code for performance and accessibility.

### Bonus:

- Implement additional features based on metafield data (e.g., filtering by material type).
- Demonstrate unit testing for Hydrogen components.
- Explain your approach to internationalization and localization for metafield content.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- Advanced Shopify API and GraphQL knowledge
- Efficient utilization of Hydrogen features and components
- Dynamic and creative approach to metafield implementation
- High-quality code with clean architecture and best practices
- Effective testing and debugging strategies
- Excellent communication and problem-solving skills
